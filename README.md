# PDF to Excel Automation Tool 🚀

## 💡 The Problem
Many businesses spend hours manually typing data from PDF reports into Excel spreadsheets. This process is slow and prone to human error.

## ✅ My Solution
I built this Python-based automation tool to:
* Extract unstructured text from any native PDF.
* Convert data into a clean, structured Excel (.xlsx) file.
* Reduce processing time from minutes to milliseconds.

## 🛠️ Tech Used
* Python 3
* Pandas (Data structuring)
* PDFPlumber (Text extraction)
